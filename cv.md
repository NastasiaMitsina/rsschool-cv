#### Hi there! <br>
My name is Anastasia and I am at the beginning of my career in IT.<br>
I am always in search of new information, useful articles about current trends and innovations. I'm interested in writing code and refactoring based on what I read. I find myself an attentive, diligent and hardworking person.<br>
I am kind, helpful and friendly person who enjoys working in a group. I think being part of a close-knit team that has one goal is very cool!

#### Example of my code:
```javascript
function findDifference(a, b) {
    let firstResult = a.reduce((total, current)=> total * current);
    let secondResult = b.reduce((total, current)=> total * current);

    return Math.abs(firstResult - secondResult);
}
console.log(findDifference([3, 2, 5], [1, 4, 4]));
```
