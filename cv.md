#### Hi there! <br>
My name is Anastasia and I am at the beginning of my career in IT.<br>
I am always in search of new information, useful articles about current trends and innovations. I'm interested in writing code and refactoring based on what I read. I find myself an attentive, diligent and hardworking person.<br>
I am kind, helpful and friendly person who enjoys working in a group. I think being part of a close-knit team that has one goal is very cool! 

#### My skills are:
1.	Great `English` skills.
2.	Knowledge of `HTML5`, `CSS3`(SASS/SCCS, Grid), `JavaScript`(ES6).
3.	Ability to use `Adobe Photoshop` and `Figma`.
4.	Basic knowledge of `React.js` and `Redux`. 
5.	Use `Webpack`.
6.	Experience in developing `SPA`. 
7.	Understanding of `Git`. 

#### Example of my code:
```javascript
function findDifference(a, b) {
    let firstResult = a.reduce((total, current)=> total * current);
    let secondResult = b.reduce((total, current)=> total * current);

    return Math.abs(firstResult - secondResult);
}
console.log(findDifference([3, 2, 5], [1, 4, 4]));
```
